Hobby project in spare time.

- Broad overview of game.
- Next target: Multiple training modes. 1)moving towards target in water and 2)walking on land

- New engine in c:

- Rationale for writing own engine:
    - "Digging down" is annoying for me. 
    - Wayy more satisfying, fun and educational.

- Rationale for C:
    - Possibility for optimization. Opitimization is important bc, i want more than realtime.
    - Simplicity.
    - Memory management is a feature. Not a hassle: Brain vectors.
    - Did it for educational reasons. Actually boosted my productivity.

- "Soon" own physics engine. Got a lot of ideas already. 

- Showcase game:

- Current release. 
- Show editing creatures. Especially editing single bodyparts.

- Show latest version:
    - Shadows.
    - Own ui engine. Will be next thing thats gonna be replaced. 
    - Start adding multiple brains. Do this in a hassle free way.
    - Better look and feel. Feels very stale. Like you're using excel or something.

Next devlog in a month or 3.
