My engine + game.

Now:

Pivot: Make alife creatures 2. Use physics engine and limbs with revolute joints.
       At first: Design the creatures and train each behavior. Then release them into 
       an ecosystem that you designed yourself. After this: design creatures that can hunt.
       then release into ecosystem. Tune macro parameters. Design behavior. Guided alife.

Collect info about ecosystem, try to create balance. Sandbox ecosystem game.

Nice: Do competition. 150 dollars for best creature. 

Decide what to do next:

Big projects:

IMPORTANT FIRST:
- Rendergroups. Abstract rendering a bit. Should make things easier for the future. Collect rendercommands.
- Use rendergroups in personal ui library.
- Better asset loading.
- Single atlas for entire ui. 
- Render to framebuffer.
- Gaussian blur.
- Shadow in 2d (simple). Use gaussian blur on shadow.
- OPTIONAL: save icons for creatures and select.
- LATER: Replace entire ui with own ui.
- LATER: abstract entre rendering out and make reusable. Make another simple game with engine.

- Fancy rendering with shadows.
- Fancy rendering with normal/specular mapping. Generate 3d textures.
- More training scenarios: Walking upright with gravity. (Hard)
- Save brain results: requires some designing.
- Create world where creatures can interact with eachother. Work towards ecosystem.
- Store multiple brains in a creature.
- Design the entire look and feel. Create your own ui library for smooth juicy ui.
- Multithreading for training.

LATER: 

- Texture editor! Create normal maps. Specular maps etc inside editor. And generate this for the terrain.
- Contact saplings developer. Wessel.
- Make googly eyes, or other decorations.
- Calculate fitness per second.
- Set fitness function before starting the simulation.
- Save entire trained brains.
- Show all inputs clearly and highlight in the world when you hover over it in 
  the brain and vice versa (when in brain vis mode).

BRAINSTORM:

Brain needs to be broken up into persistent and transient part. Dynamic part is required in creature.
But while training multiple persistent parts are required. 

Gene -> persistent brain.

- Train creatures for individual task. Manage high level behavior with behavior tree. 
  
Low level behavior:
    Move forward
    Turn left 
    Turn right
    Move grabber to relative position. (independent of attachment)
    Attack to relative position.
    Grab and put down (building nests)

BIG QUESTIONS: 
- How to orient creature. Determine a body that contains the brain/heart?

COOL THINGS:
    Infinite generated zoom. Generate cells, dna, atoms.
    Fancy textures + normals and lighting.
    Generate textures, based on dna.
    Draw on textures.

Make everything look good. Its ugly now.

Some lay eggs, some dont.
complicated long term behavior. 
Carnivore herbivore ofcourse.

STUDY BIOLOGY:

And implement specific behavior and ecosystems.

MORE AI:
    Make Ai library that only uses bytes instead of floats.

RESEARCH:
    It would be nice to know the effect of an input on the output to
    see if an input is actually being used. Think of a meassure for this.
    Can also be used in robotics. Learning how neural networks actually work
    and generating feedback based on this.

FUN:
    Visualize everything!!!!
    especially training: show each epsilon at the same time . 
    Show combining and averaging and going to next generation. Show forming of brains.
    This helps with debugging and its fun to look at. 
    Show graph, numbers, everything.

    Make brain location, show connections. 
    Make googly eyes, mouth, claws.

    Make everything wiggly. Including mouse cursor. Pay attention to details.

    Make gun creature for video.

    Make videos and make the interface SUUPER clear. Put a lot of effort into it.
    Make it understandable. Polish is important.
    
    Also make a competition and give a reward of 150 dollars to someone who makes the
    most creative creature.

    IDEA: Export creature texture as image. Tag bodyparts (manualy in editor). put your own body on it in gimp.
    IDEA: @ Lex Fridman in mijn volgende tweets. En @openai over hun ES paper. Denk groots
    IDEA: Schrijf website waar gedeeltes van ecosystemen gedownload kunnen worden. Animeer creatures in javascript.
