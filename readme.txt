My engine + game.

Now:

Pivot: Make alife creatures 2. Use physics engine and limbs with revolute joints.
       At first: Design the creatures and train each behavior. Then release them into 
       an ecosystem that you designed yourself. After this: design creatures that can hunt.
       then release into ecosystem. Tune macro parameters. Design behavior. Guided alife.

Collect info about ecosystem, try to create balance. Sandbox ecosystem game.

BRAINSTORM:

Brain needs to be broken up into persistent and transient part. Dynamic part is required in creature.
But while training multiple persistent parts are required. 

Gene -> persistent brain.

- Train creatures for individual task. Manage high level behavior with behavior tree. 
  
Low level behavior:
    Move forward
    Turn left 
    Turn right
    Move grabber to relative position. (independent of attachment)
    Attack to relative position.
    Grab and put down (building nests)

BIG QUESTIONS: 
- How to orient creature. Determine a body that contains the brain/heart?

COOL THINGS:
    Infinite generated zoom. Generate cells, dna, atoms.
    Fancy textures + normals and lighting.
    Generate textures, based on dna.
    Draw on textures.

Some lay eggs, some dont.
complicated long term behavior. 
Carnivore herbivore ofcourse.

STUDY BIOLOGY:

And implement specific behavior and ecosystems.

MORE AI:
    Make Ai library that only uses bytes instead of floats.

FUN:
    Visualize everything!!!!
    especially training: show each epsilon at the same time . 
    Show combining and averaging and going to next generation. Show forming of brains.
    This helps with debugging and its fun to look at. 
    Show graph, numbers, everything.

    Make brain location, show connections. 
    Make googly eyes, mouth, claws.

    Make everything wiggly. Including mouse cursor. Pay attention to details.

    Make gun creature for video.
